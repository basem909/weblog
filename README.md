## Getting Started

This repository includes files with Ruby that can be used to test the created main classes from the app

Clone this link into your local device.

To run test make sure that rspec-rails and capybara libraries are installed in your project

To double check please run:
```
bundle install
```
This will install both gems if they were missing in your environment.

To run all tests including, user and post controllers (both features and request) please run rspec in the main project folder:
```
rspec
```

To run test for a specific test run rspec and add the location of the file:
```
